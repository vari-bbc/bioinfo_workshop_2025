MissingOutputException in rule sum_letter_counts in file "/varidata/research/projects/bbc/research/bioinfo_workshop_2025/workshop_2/ex01/Snakefile", line 18:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/sum_letter_counts/summed.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
